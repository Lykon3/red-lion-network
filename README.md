# 🦁 RED LION NETWORK 😈👿

> God, guns, and narrative laundering for the meme era.

This repo documents one of the dumbest serious threats to democracy we’ve seen in modern history.  
A minister-turned-mercenary with shell companies, a tactical cosplay wife, and a private security firm named after the Roman dudes who used to assassinate emperors.  
Oh—and AI brainwashing. And a Department of Defense tweet with the Russian flag on Flag Day.

## 🤡 What’s Inside

- A guy named **Boelter** who said he was a prophet, then showed up with a Glock.
- Shell companies claiming to run agriculture, media, and "women’s empowerment" out of the Congo. (Totally real.)
- A pattern detector that flags how these groups keep pulling the same playbook.
- Timeline of events, because yes, this was years in the making.
- Banner art that looks like the end of faith and capitalism had a baby.

## 🙃 Why This Exists

Because when politicians are getting shot, and bots are quoting scripture, and everyone’s too emotionally fried to care, someone has to write it down.

This is that.
