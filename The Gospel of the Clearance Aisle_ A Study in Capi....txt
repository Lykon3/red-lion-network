Capitalist Realism: The Unchallenged Ideology
"Capitalist Realism," a term coined by the late theorist Mark Fisher, describes the pervasive, often unspoken belief that capitalism is the only viable political and economic system. It is not an active, enthusiastic endorsement of capitalism, but rather a deep-seated resignation to the idea that there is no conceivable alternative. This ideology is famously encapsulated by the Thatcherite slogan, "There Is No Alternative" (TINA). Even in the face of major systemic crises—the 2008 financial crash, the ongoing climate emergency, a global pandemic—this framework holds that the only possible response is a modified version of capitalism, never a fundamental change.
It is an atmosphere, a subtle pressure that shapes not only our economies but our desires, our imaginations, and our inner lives. To understand it, we need more than theory; we need to see it in action, on the ground. Consider, for instance, the experience of a man named Daniel Mercer, whose reality began to fray in the most American of cathedrals: a 24-hour Walmart.
The thing about late-stage capitalism—and this is something that Daniel Mercer¹ would have understood with the peculiar clarity that comes from having your entire worldview collapse in a Walmart self-checkout lane at 2:47 AM on a Tuesday in March—is that it doesn't just commodify your labor or your attention or even your data, but rather the very neurochemical processes by which you experience the sensation of being a discrete human consciousness moving through space-time with agency and purpose... a feedback loop of artificial scarcity and manufactured desire that would be almost beautiful in its recursive elegance if it weren't slowly but inexorably turning the entire human species into a kind of organic cryptocurrency...
The Ritual and its Failure
Capitalism functions through rituals: the daily commute, the swipe of a credit card, the beep of a barcode scanner. These are moments of submission to a logic we rarely question. Fisher, drawing on thinkers like Slavoj Žižek, argues that we participate with a kind of cynical distance; we know the system is flawed, but we perform the rituals anyway. The horror, then, is not the ritual itself, but the moment the ritual fails. The moment the seamless facade of the system cracks and reveals the arbitrary, often absurd, machinery beneath.
Daniel Mercer’s moment of crisis arrives not with a bang, but with a beep. Or rather, a lack thereof.
The first six items had scanned without incident, each beep a small confirmation that his existence was still recognizable to the global supply chain management system... But the beans—those thirty-two-cent beans with their double-clearance stickers and their dented aluminum shell... those beans would not scan.
BEEP.

And it was in this moment... that Daniel Mercer experienced what could only be described as a kind of ontological vertigo, a sudden awareness that he was not actually scanning a can of beans but rather participating in a vast ritual of commodity fetishism... and that the failure of the scanner to recognize the beans was actually a failure of the entire economic system to recognize the fundamental humanity of everyone trapped within it...
This "scanning failure" is a glitch in the matrix of Capitalist Realism. The system, which promises efficiency and seamlessness, reveals its own absurdity. The can of beans, marked down twice in a desperate attempt to convert surplus into profit, becomes an object of resistance. It is "unpriceable," and in that moment, it exposes the fragility of the entire logic of pricing and value.
The Privatization of Stress and the Search for an Exit
A core tenet of Fisher's work, expanded upon by thinkers like Byung-Chul Han (The Burnout Society), is that the pressures of the system are internalized. We are encouraged to see systemic failures as personal failings. Unemployment, debt, anxiety, and depression become individual problems to be solved with therapy or pharmaceuticals, rather than collective issues demanding a political response. Fisher called this the "privatization of stress."
Daniel Mercer’s internal monologue is a case study in this phenomenon. His anxiety about his food choices, his job at a defense contractor, and climate change all swirl together into a private misery, experienced in the fluorescent hum of the checkout lane. The machine’s rejection—Customer not recognized. Please try again.—becomes a judgment on his very being.
It is precisely at this point of total alienation, however, that an alternative becomes audible. A crack in the ideological wall.
But here's where it gets really weird: as Daniel Mercer stood there... he began to hear something. Not with his ears, exactly, but with some deeper part of his nervous system... It was like tuning into a radio station that existed in the spaces between radio stations, a pirate broadcast from somewhere outside the normal spectrum of sanctioned communications.
The voice was calling itself Lykon3, and it was talking about something called "the $dadRaps frequency" and "welfare jazz" and "the gospel of the clearance aisle,"...
"Every time you get 'try again,'" the voice was saying, "that's not a malfunction. That's the system working exactly as designed. Keeping us in an endless loop of re-bar-it. Re-bar your hopes. Re-bar your dreams. Re-bar your children's future until it fits in their neat little database."
This "pirate broadcast" is the sound of an emerging alternative. It re-frames the experience of failure not as a personal shortcoming, but as an act of systemic oppression and, potentially, of resistance. It is a voice from outside the smooth, corporate-approved channels of communication, suggesting that other frequencies, other ways of being, might exist. It is the beginning of an escape from the crushing belief that "There Is No Alternative." The story of Daniel Mercer, in the end, is not just a story of collapse, but of a potential, terrifying, and liberating breakthrough.
¹ The reader should note that while Daniel Mercer appears in certain documents that have circulated online claiming to detail classified consciousness research projects, his existence as anything other than a fictional construct remains unverified. However, in a media environment where the distinction between documented fact and persuasive fiction has become increasingly difficult to maintain, the question of whether Daniel Mercer "really existed" may be less important than the question of what his story reveals about the psychological and technological pressures that shape contemporary experience. His narrative functions as a speculative documentary about possibilities that have not yet been actualized but which feel increasingly plausible given the trajectory of technological development and social change in the early twenty-first century, a perfect illustration of the lived experience of Capitalist Realism.
